The Challenge 
 

Recreate https://preprlabs.org/ page(after login). You can select any framework or IDE you preferred and please also provide a dark mode button. You should be able to switch between two modes:
 

All mouseover effects need to work. But you only need to implement the following click events: search bar(doesn't need to actually search, but it should respond to keyboard input), menu expansion/collapse, view switching between challenge/lab/project.
 
The design needs to be responsive.
 
When you refresh the browser, the dark mode does not need to persist.
 
You do not need to consider an accessibility button in this challenge. 
 
Feel free to re-design this page to showcase your creativity.
 

 

Assessment Criteria:

Code Quality - Is the code clear, well tested and well documented? Does the system work as expected without bugs?
 

Efficiency of Solution - Can this design be easily implemented? Does it appropriately communicate user experience principles?
 

Completeness - How well the system is completed? How many functions are actually working?
 

Creativity -  Is the solution visually appealing and memorable?

Requirements



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
